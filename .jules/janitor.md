# Janitor's Journal

This journal is for CRITICAL refactoring learnings only.

**DO NOT** add entries for routine work like fixing lint errors or renaming variables.

**ONLY** add entries when you discover:
- A complexity pattern that repeatedly appears in this codebase
- A refactoring that had unexpected side effects
- A rejected change with important architectural constraints
- A particularly effective simplification pattern for this project
- A recurring lint/style issue specific to this codebase

## YYYY-MM-DD - [Title]
**Issue:** [What complexity/chaos you found]
**Root Cause:** [Why it existed]
**Solution:** [How you simplified it]
**Pattern:** [Reusable lesson for this codebase]
